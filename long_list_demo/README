Native Extension control for long list Demo.

In that application we have a test page where user can open native
long list control and select item from list. When user select item -
application return to web view and show selected info.

We have a list with 10000 items.
Each item contain image and 3 text field.

data for items requested from native control by demand. Ruby control
prepare data in XML/JSON format.

I add 10 different images to application , but now each item load
image separately without any caching - in this case application can
have unique image for each item without any perfomance losses.

As I say before - native control works without any visual pause.

Native extension prepared for iOS and Android.
